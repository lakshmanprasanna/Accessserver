App description


The app will download and display photos. The course server is at
http://bismarck.sdsu.edu/photoserver/. Anyone can access the photos on the server. Only registered
users can upload photos to the server. Your app should first show a list of users. When
a user selects a user the app shows them a list of photo names from that user. When the user
selects a photo name, then the app shows the photo. In this assignment we will do this with
three different activities. The app is targeted for a phone, not a tablet. Part of the extra credit
will be to have the app run on a phone and a tablet. So you might want to use fragments from
the beginning.

Downloading a photo is a three step process. First one needs to get a list of current registered
users. This is done using the following http GET request. Note that this is a regular http request
so you can copy the url below into a web browser to see the result of the request. You should
try this will all the urls given below.

http://bismarck.sdsu.edu/photoserver/userlist

The server response is a JSON array. The array contains a JSON object for each registered
user that has photos on the server. Users that have not uploaded photos are not listed. The
JSON object for a users contains a "name" field and an "id" field. Here is an example response.

[{"name":"Roger Whitney","id":"1"},{"name":"Mystery Man","id":"2"}].
To get a list of the photo of a user one uses the user's id in an HTTP GET request. Here is how
you request the list of photos for user with id "2". To get the list of photos for a different user
you replace the "2" with the user's id.

http://bismarck.sdsu.edu/photoserver/userphotos/2

The server responds with a JSON array. The array contains a JSON object for each photo the
given users has on the server. The JSON object for a photo contains a "name" field and an "id"
field. Here is an example response.

[{"name":"dog","id":"23"},{"name":"dots","id":"24"},{"name":"moonWeeds","id":"31"}]

To download a photo one uses another GET request. Here is how you get the photo with id
"24". Again you change the id to get a different photo.

http://bismarck.sdsu.edu/photoserver/photo/24

The server responds with a document of type "image/jpeg" and the bytes that make up the
photo. That is the server sends back the contents of the photo.
Comments about the HTTP GET commands


1. Since these are HTTP ULRs you can and should try them in a web browser. This can help
you debugging your app as you will be able to see the server response.

2. The HTTP URLs are case sensitive. Note that all the URLs above are all lowercase.

3. When there is a problem with a request the server responds with an HTTP response code of
404 and a message trying to describe the problem. The response code of 404 will cause the
Android HTTP clients to throw an exception. You should handle this case. The exception will
contain the error message. The first point above may be useful when this happens.

4. The ids for the users and photos are for internal use in your app. The ids have no meaning
to users so they should not be displayed to users of your app.
Extra Credit
Will include uploading photos, caching photos on devices, showing thumbnails of photos with
list of photo names and using gestures to move between photos and displaying
Uploading photos. Allow the user to upload photos from their phone to the server. The user
should be able to select a photo from their photo library on the phone and upload it. To upload
a photo you need to use the following POST url:

http://bismarck.sdsu.edu/photoserver/postphoto/username/userpassword/photoname
Where:
username is the user name of the account on the server that you are uploading the photo
to
userpassword is the password of the username account
photoname is the name of the photo you are uploading
The bytes of the photo are to be sent in the body of the post in a File Entity (that is not streaming).
Your account name is your first name as given in Blackboard. If your first name as more
than one word it is the first word in your first name. Your password is the last for digits in your
RedID. If successful the server returns a JSON object contain the id of the photo just added.
For example:
{"id":"12"}
Saving Photos. Save photos to permanent storage to allow off-line usage and to provide
faster viewing. When the app needs to display a photo you first check to see if the photo is already
saved on the device.
Saving User and photo lists. Save the list of users and list of photos in the device database
to allow off-line usage.
Thumbnail view. When you display the list of photo names add a thumbnail view of the photo.
Swipe gesture. When displaying a photo use a swipe left or right to display the next or previous
photo from the same person.
Tablet version. The app should run on a phone and a tablet. The tablet version should make
good use of the extra screen size. For example on the phone version one would likely use one
screen to show a list of users. The list of photos from that user will be another screen. And the
photo itself will be a third screen. On the tablet here is room to show a list and a photo at the
same time, so do so.
